# Roblox Player 32 Bit

**Made by Luxlather and Uzid** on discord. This project was made because me and my friend Uzid are both elite lua coders.
We script on roblox so we needed a fresh slate so instead of using Microsoft version we decided to make it 32 Bit.

# Project/Info

**(Copying code from other Apps is illegal, me and my friend did it because we were guided)**
